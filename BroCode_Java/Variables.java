/* 
    Variable -> a re-usable container for a value;
        a variable behaves as if it was the value it contains

    Two types of variables:
    - Primitive -> simple value stored directly in memory (stack)
    - Reference -> memory address (stack) that points to the heap.

    Primitive examples -> int, double, float, char, boolean
    Reference examples -> string, array, object

    2 steps to declare any variable -
        1. declaration
        2. assignment
